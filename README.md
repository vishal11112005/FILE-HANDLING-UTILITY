##This Java File Handling Utility program was developed using an online Java compiler, which allows writing, compiling, and executing Java code directly through a web browser without installing any software locally. Online compilers are convenient, platform-independent, and ideal for quick testing, learning, and demonstrating Java programs, especially in academic and internship environments.
The project focuses on implementing file handling operations in Java, such as creating, reading, writing, and modifying text files. The program provides a simple menu-driven interface where users can choose different file operations. Based on the selected option, the program can write data into a text file, read and display the contents of an existing file, or modify the file by appending new data. Java’s standard input-output classes are used to ensure efficient and reliable file operations.
This code can be used in many real-world scenarios where basic text file management is required. It is suitable for applications such as log file handling, report storage, student or employee record maintenance, configuration file management, and small-scale data storage systems. The program can also serve as a foundation for more advanced applications, including file-based databases, backup utilities, and data processing tools.
From a learning perspective, this project is highly beneficial for beginners. It helps in understanding how Java interacts with external files, how user input controls program execution, and how file operations are performed safely. Using an online compiler makes the project accessible from anywhere and simplifies collaboration and testing.
Overall, this project demonstrates the practical use of Java file handling concepts developed using an online compiler and shows how simple Java programs can effectively manage and manipulate text-based data.
